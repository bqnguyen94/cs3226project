	<h5 class="col-xs-12">NUSFood is an online food ordering system that sells to mainly NUS students and staffs. Food is then delivered from restaurants and food stalls within school campus by students for other students. Our focus is on providing a more affordable mode of delivery, as compared to more invested companies such as Deliveroo, and help students who do not have time to queue up to acquire their food.</h5>
